This is the final project for CMPT 218 Web Development course. The objective is to create a 3D tic-tac-toe web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

Users need to register accounts in order to play the game. Their information and game histories are stored in MongoDB database for analytics and future reference. In the game, users get matched to another player automatically. Each player can only make one move per turn, and once a player wins, a status board will pop up for both players to show their game histories and summaries correspondingly.

## Notes

The server and database were hosted on the school's system, which is not available now.
